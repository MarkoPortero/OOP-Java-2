One player will choose a word and the other will guess the word. This is the person that invents 
the puzzle for the other person to solve. They will be tasked with choosing a word or phrase that 
"the players" will have to solve.

The host should be able to spell confidently or the game will be difficult to win.

If you are the creator, choose a secret word. The other players will need to guess your word letter by letter, so 
choose a word you think will be difficult to guess. Difficult words usually have uncommon letters, like "z," or "j," 
and only a few vowels.

For longer games, you can also choose phrases.

Start guessing letters if you are the player. Once the word has been chosen and the players know how many 
letters in the secret word, begin guessing which letters are in the word by asking the host. 
For example, you might begin by asking, "is there an 'e' in your word?"

Generally, start by guessing common letters like vowels, "s," "t," and "n."

The computer will automatically keep a record of all guesses made by the user, 
as well as automatically populating the word with correct guesses.

On wrong guesses, the computer will populate a hangman. 
Once the hangman has been fully drawn, you have one last attempt to finish the word, else the man will hang!
